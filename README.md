# Drinking Tracker
This is a RESTful API that allows the user to track their drinking habits over the
course of an evening. The tracker tracks a user's number of drinks over a number of hours,
as well as a number of hookups, total calories consumed, and whether or not the user did
in fact puke. This was a fun assignment, and a good chance to practice RESTful services!
